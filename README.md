urdf generic launch CLI test:
`xacro robot.urdf.xacro > test.urdf end_effector_type:=mock_pruner eef_parent:=ur5e__tool0 arm_type:=ur5 ur_type:=ur5e tf_prefix:=ur5e__ base_attachment_type:=linear_slider`

## TODO
1. For Claire: 
    1. Figure out best way to manage tree/robot/environment interaction. I removed robot from penv, but self.trees still exists. 
    1. Fill out the `object_loader.py` class. Activate/deactivate trees, supports, robots.
    1. Find the `TODO`s in all the code. Ask Luke what they mean and discuss solutions.
1. Format the final approach controller as a python subpackage?
    1. https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/packaging-namespace-packages/#packaging-namespace-packages
1. Add basic cylinder to world. Dynamically create URDF.
1. Separate camera class
    1. ToF class inherits camera classs
1. Dynamically populate UR URDF. Allow for various end-effectors and robot configurations.
    1. Make sure to include camera and other sensors. (Source manifold mesh -- utils -> camera class (C++))
    1. Dynamic parent joint for Panda to slider/farm-ng (like UR5)
1. Add generic robot class (from Abhinav's code)
    1. Panda/UR5
    1. End-effector
1. Make mini orchard from a set of URDFs
    1. Space out like normal orchard
    1. Be aware of memory issues in PyB
1. Change pkl files to hdf5. (lower priority)
1. Test
    1. Various tof configurations
